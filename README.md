# CSE 3311 Semester Project

## How To Run:
The simplest way to run this project is through Visual Studio Code. Steps:
1. Download the repository
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.
4. Right click on "GamePage.html" and "Open with Live Server".

Code comments were added to the files to help explain the codebase:
