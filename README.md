# CSE 3311 Semester Project

## How To Run:
The simplest way to run this project is to go to the Github hosted webpage: https://cse3311-team3.github.io/3311-Project/

If the link doesn't work, the easiest alternate method is through Visual Studio Code. Steps:
1. Download the repository
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.
4. Right click on "GamePage.html" and "Open with Live Server".

Code comments were added to the files to help explain the codebase:
* GamePage.js
* Real_Emails/template1.js
* Email.js

The comments added in Email.js and Real_Emails/template1 explained how the codebase worked for a single.template. The comments can be applied to the other templates.
